This book was written by *Zmavli Caimle*, and reviewed by the creator of
Eberban, *mia entropy*, who also provided typesetting help.

**This book is a work in progress, and the text may change drastically and
suddenly, either due to rewriting or changes in the language itself.**

Future topics (subject to change). (N) lessons introduce new grammar, while
those without the tag do not introduce any new grammar at all (but may use
existing structures in ways not previously shown). (N*) lessons introduce a
small amount of new grammar that greatly parallels or reuse previously covered
structures.
