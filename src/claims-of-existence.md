The most basic type of sentence is a claim of existence. In English, they are in the form of "There is/are X".

<gloss>
There is an apple

{There is} {an apple}

{∃x:} {apple(x)}

There exists an X such that X is an apple.

Note that although the English translations and examples in this book will usually be in the singular, this is only because English mandates that words be inflected for number. Sekko does not mandate this, and so words may refer to one or more entities. Explicit declarations of number will be covered in [Numerals](numerals.md).

What does **∃** or **apple(x)** mean?

The symbol **∃** is called the existential quantifier.
