# Reading word definitions

Let us consider transitive verbs and prepositions in English, specifically the
word **go**. This word is a transitive verb, meaning that it takes a subject and
an object.

> I go there.
> 
> SUBJ-1PS go OBJ-there

One may generalize this and define **go** as such:

> go: x1 goes to x2

This is the manner by which Eberban's vocabulary is defined. Each predicate has
one to four parameters which can be "filled" by arguments. Let us look at the
definition of an Eberban word, usually called a predicate. 

> **fuir** : (E-Xd) knows fact \[A-P0\] from source (O-Xd).

What do the letters and numbers in the parentheticals mean? The first component
is a letter -- E, A, O or U, corresponding to the first, second, third, and
fourth places of the predicate respectively. The second component refers to the
type of argument the parameter accepts.

- **X** parameters refer to concretes -- specific entities or an events. We
  shall focus on X parameters exclusively for now.
- **P** parameters refer to propositions -- a particular abstract concept,
  property, or relation. These are covered in [P chapter]()
- **S** parameters (not seen here) refer to sequences -- lists of X, P or S
  arguments. These are covered in [S chapter]()
- **N** parameters refer to numbers. These are covered in [N chapter]()

One does not need to worry about the third component as of now, but they will be
listed here for completeness. The third component refers to the distributivity
or collectivity of arguments for X parameters; the number of variables bound by
the proposition in P parameters; or the type of arguments to be listed in S
parameters.

We will only cover predicates with X parameters from now until [P0 chapter]().
However, reading predicate definitions should be learned now, even if the other
three places will not be covered until later.
