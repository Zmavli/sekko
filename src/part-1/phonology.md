# Phonology

The phonology of Eberban is described in greater detail in [the official grammar
book](). If technical explanations and IPA are desired, refer to it instead. This
book will provide a layman's explanation.

Assuming that the reader is a native English speaker, all letters are spoken the
same way as their English counterparts, but with a several exceptions. For
vowels:

- **a** is spoken like in "f**a**ther", never like in "comm**a**".
- **o** is spoken like in "l**o**rd", never like in "b**oo**t".
- **e** is spoken like in "b**e**t", never like in "b**ee**t".
- 

Note that the English words used may not necessarily correspond with the
canonical or correct pronunciation depending on your accent -- for those, refer
to the official book. For consonants:

- **c** is the "sh" in "**sh**ell".
- The sound for **j** does not exist in English proper, but it's the "ge" in
  "lu**ge**" or the **g** in "bour**g**eois". It's the voiced equivalent of the
  previous letter, **c**.
- **tc** is the "ch" in "**ch**ime".
- **dj** is the "j" in "**j**am".
