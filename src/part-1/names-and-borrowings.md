In many language courses, the first lesson teaches how one introduces one's
self. This book will do something similar. This lesson will cover how names are
used in Eberban, as well as the process by which foreign words are borrowed into
it.

Suppose that one wants to name one's self **dzu** (magenta). If one merely says
**dzu**:

<gloss>
dzu

dzu

{(E-Xd) is magenta}

An entity is colored magenta.
</gloss>

One asserts that "something is magenta". That is not what one wants. The exact
processes of the grammar will be covered in future chapters. 

> For now, pay no attention to `(E-Xd)` -- simply take it to be single parameter
> which can accept arguments.

What one wants is to say the name "Magenta", not "Something is magenta." To do
this, one ought to use the particle **za** (of the particle family **ZI**).

> shown in parentheses. Particles of the same class have the same (or very

The particle **za** has the following grammar:

> **za** : (E-Xd) is named :

What one want, then, is **za dzu**. 

<gloss>
za dzu

za dzu

{(E-Xd) is named :} {Magenta}.

An entity that is named "Magenta".
</gloss>

What if one wants to use a non-Eberbanic name? Suppose one's name is "Anna
Livingstone". How does one say that in Eberban? First, one should transliterate
the name, obeying Eberban borrowing morphology rules. A simplified explanation
is given for now.

> Borrowings must start with **u**. For words that already start with **u**, add
> a boundary marker, making the start of the word **u'u**. Borrowings must end
> with either a vowel or **n**, **r** or **l**. Borrowings must use only Eberban
> sounds.

In this case, the transliteration is **ana livinsto**. In Eberban, non-native
words (borrowings) must be prefixed with **u**, making the borrowing **u'ana
ulivinsto**. Borrowings which are adjacent to one another are treated as being
part of the same borrowing. Therefore, **u'ana ulivinsto** means "Anna
Livingstone" rather than "Anna" and "Livingstone". While there is a mechanism
for the separation of borrowings, it is covered in a later chapter.

<gloss>
uana ulivinsto

{uana ulivinsto}

{(E-Xd) is an Anna Livingstone.}

An entity which is an Anna Livingstone.
</gloss>

That is not yet what one wants. All borrowings have the place structure `(E-Xd)
is a/some "borrowing(s)"`. If one wants to refer to someone *named* Anna
Livingstone, one will have to use **za** again.

<gloss>
za uana ulivinsto

za {uana ulivinsto}

{(E-Xd) is an entity named:} {Anna Livingstone}.

An entity which is named Anna Livingstone.
</gloss>

One should transliterate your name or moniker into Eberban, or select words from
the dictionary to form one's name, if desired.

It should be noted that any foreign word can be borrowed, not just names.

<gloss>
ubanbu

ubanbu

{(E-Xd) is bamboo.}

An entity which is bamboo.
</gloss>

<gloss>
umakaroni

umakaroni

{(E-Xd) is macaroni.}

An entity which is macaroni.
</gloss>

### Exercise 02.1: English to Eberban Transliteration
*No mastery will come without work. To learn truly, follow the exercises.*

Transliterate the following English words into Eberban.

<spoiler>
Paris

Preferably, **upari**. However, **uparisi** is also acceptable.
</spoiler>

<spoiler>
New York

**uniu uior**. "York" may also be **uiorko**.
</spoiler>

<spoiler>
Raymond Davis

Preferably, **ureimon udeivisi**. "Raymond" may also be **ureimondo**, and "Davis" **udeivi**, but that sounds like "Davy".
</spoiler>

<spoiler>
abalone

**uabalon**.
</spoiler>

<spoiler>
baseball

Preferably, **ubeisbo**. However, **ubeisbolo** is also acceptable.
</spoiler>

Transliteration is more art than science -- so long as it resembles the original pronunciation and obeys morphological rules, it is correct. The answers are merely the canonical transliterations.

> The reason why particle families are written with capital letters is because Eberban is descended from Lojban. Lojban writes particle families in such a manner, and that is how Eberban does it as well.
