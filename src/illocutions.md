# Illocutions
We are ready now to make true sentences in Sekko. All of the "sentences" thus far have been termed utterances, for they are not true sentences. True sentences in Sekko *must* contain an illocution. An illocution, also known as a speech act, determines what the purpose of the utterance is. Utterances may, for example, be simply stating information, or desiring information, or commanding. Sekko illocution suffixes also function as sentence fences. Illocution markers in Sekko are mandatory and always attach to the first word of the sentence. Given this, Sekko sentence boundaries can also be unambiguously determined.

The most basic illocution in Sekko is the *assertive* illocution `-n`, glossed as (AST). It marks the sentence as merely a bare assertion. All of the utterances we have examined thus far implicitly took on the assertive illocution.

<gloss>
An apple is red.

{Seebon} {rubro.}

{\\(∃x: apple(x),\\)} {\\(red(x)\\)}
	
I assert that: There exists X such that X is an apple, and is red.
</gloss>

The *imperative* (IMP) `-rro` illocution marks the sentence as being a command or demand, with the implicit threat of punishment or negative consequences if the command is not made true.

<gloss>
(You) get away from me!

{Dorro} {kulai} {kaukai} {ko!}

{\\(∃x∃y∃z: you(x),\\)} {\\(travel(x,y),\\)} {\\(far(y,z),\\)} {\\(me(z)\\)} 
	
I command that: There exists X, Y, and Z such that X is you, and travels to Y and Y is far from Z, and Z is me.
</gloss>

The *suggestive* (SUG) illocution `-le` is similar to the imperative illocution, in that it expresses a desire for something to be made true. However, unlike the imperative, it does not contain an implicit threat. When the suggestive illocution is used, it is being claimed that the interlocutor may decline or refuse to bring about the desired state without retribution or negative consequence. The suggestive illocution can be made for requests, offers, or as the name suggests, suggestions.

<gloss>
(You) please sit./I suggest you sit./I request you sit./I offer for you to sit.

{Dole} {suato.}

{\\(∃x: you(x),\\)} {\\(sitting(x)\\)}
	
I suggest that: There exists X such that X is you, and is sitting.
</gloss>

The *interrogative* (INT) illocution `-ma` marks the sentence as a question. How a language handles question syntax is of particular importance, and so interrogatives are given their own chapter.
