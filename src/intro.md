The information in this book may change suddenly due to the language being in its infancy.

In the far future, it is my intention to create a teaching book (which will present Sekko from first principles, and relate its structures to natural language structures), and a reference grammar (which is intended to give a purely technical description of Sekko). Since Sekko is young, this current book will attempt to do both.

Further, because of the two-goal nature of this book, it necessarily is not optimized for either goal. It is recommended that readers re-read earlier chapters, as many chapters are interlinked with one another. The nature of human language, however, forces the book to be arranged sequentially.
