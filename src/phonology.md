Sekko features both consonant and vowel gemination. Geminated sounds are notated by writing the same letter twice (e.g. "nn" for /nː/ and "aa" for /aː/). Consonant and vowel charts in IPA are given below, with Latin letter orthography in wide angle brackets.
## Consonants
|             | Labial    | Alveolar | Post-alveolar | Palatal | Velar    | Glottal |
|:------------|:---------:|:--------:|:-------------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Nasal       |    m ⟨m⟩      | n ⟨n⟩          |               |    (ɲ)  |   ŋ ⟨q⟩  |         |
| Plosive     | p ⟨p⟩<br>b ⟨b⟩ | t ⟨t⟩<br>d ⟨d⟩ |               |         | k ⟨k⟩<br>g ⟨g⟩ | ʔ   ⟨x⟩ |
| Fricative   |              | s ⟨s⟩<br>z ⟨z⟩ | ʃ ⟨c⟩<br>ʒ ⟨j⟩   |         |          | h ⟨h⟩   |
| Approximant |    (w)       |               |    l ⟨l⟩       |    (j)  |          |         |
| Tap         |              |   ɾ ⟨r⟩        |               |         |          |         |
| Trill       |              |   r ⟨rr⟩       |               |         |          |         |

The geminated form of **ɾ ⟨r⟩** is **r ⟨rr⟩**. 

The sounds **ɲ**, **ʔ ⟨x⟩**, **h ⟨h⟩**, **w** and **j** are forbidden from geminating, and are canonically pronounced short.

## Vowels
|           | Front | Central | Back |
|:----------|:-----:|:-------:|:----:|
| Close     | i ⟨i⟩ |          | u ⟨u⟩ |
| Close-mid |      |          | o ⟨o⟩ |
| Open-mid  | ε ⟨e⟩ |          |      |
| Open      | a ⟨a⟩ |          |      |

All vowels may geminate. 

### Diphthongs

The following diphthongs are permitted: **iV**, **Vi**, **uV**, **Vu**, where V represents any vowel. It is permitted to pronounce the diphthong either with hiatus (two syllables), or with glide (one syllable). Diphthongs involving **i** use the approximant **j**, and **u** with **w**. 

In the cases where the diphthong is **iV** or **uV**, and the diphthong is pronounced with glide, the preceding consonant will be palatalized or labialized respectively. Sequences of **niV** may be pronounced as **ɲV**.

N-phthongs are permitted so long as all adjacent vowels are valid diphthongs (i.e. the nucleus **aieua** is permitted as **ai**, **ie**, **eu**, and **ua** are valid diphthongs).

Vowel gemination is forbidden in diphthongs.

## Phonotactics

Words cannot begin and end with geminated sounds.

Words cannot begin with vowels.
